# Quickstart

Get your first AI agent running in your Linear workspace.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- A Linear workspace (admin access for OAuth app)

## Step 1: Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @sniff-dev/cli
```

Or with bun:

```bash
bun install -g @sniff-dev/cli
```

## Step 2: Create Linear OAuth App

1. Go to [Linear Settings → OAuth applications](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications)
2. Click **New OAuth Application**
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: Sniff Agent
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://sniff-proxy.workers.dev/auth/linear/callback`
4. Under **Actor**, select **Application** (required for agent features)
5. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Configure Linear Webhook

1. Go to **Linear Settings** → **API** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **New Webhook**
3. Set the URL to: `https://sniff-proxy.workers.dev/webhook/linear`
4. Select App events: **Agent sessions events**
5. Click **Create**

## Step 4: Initialize and Authenticate

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
sniff init
sniff auth linear
```

This creates a `sniff.yml` config and opens your browser for OAuth authentication.

Edit the generated `sniff.yml`:

```yaml
version: "2.0"

agents:
  - id: engineer
    name: Engineer
    systemPrompt: |
      You are a software engineer. Help with coding tasks,
      bug fixes, and code reviews. Write clean, tested code.
    runner:
      claude:
        allowedTools:
          - Read
          - Write
          - Edit
          - Glob
          - Grep
          - Bash
        permissionMode: acceptEdits
        maxTurns: 50
```

## Step 5: Start the Agent

```bash
sniff start
```

You should see:

```
Connecting to https://sniff-proxy.workers.dev...

Connected to proxy
Sniffing for webhooks...
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Test It Out

1. Go to Linear and open any issue
2. Mention your agent with `@Sniff` or delegate the issue to it
3. Watch your terminal - the agent will process the request
4. Check Linear - the agent's response appears as a comment

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth fails or times out">
    - Verify the redirect URI in Linear matches `https://sniff-proxy.workers.dev/auth/linear/callback`
    - Try re-authenticating: `sniff auth linear --force`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection fails">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify you've authenticated: `sniff auth linear`
    - Try with verbose logging: `sniff start -v`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not responding to issues">
    - Verify you've set up the webhook in Linear Settings → API → Webhooks
    - Check that webhook URL is `https://sniff-proxy.workers.dev/webhook/linear`
    - Ensure you're mentioning or delegating to the agent correctly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token refresh errors">
    - Re-authenticate: `sniff auth linear --force`
