# Quickstart

Get your first AI agent running with the Sniff CLI and a local proxy.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or similar tunnel tool
- A Linear workspace (admin access for OAuth app)

## Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sniff-dev/sniff.git
cd sniff
bun install
```

## Step 2: Create Linear OAuth App

1. Go to [Linear Settings → OAuth applications](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications)
2. Click **New OAuth Application**
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: Sniff Agent
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8787/auth/linear/callback` (we'll update this later)
4. Under **Actor**, select **Application** (required for agent features)
5. Click **Create**
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Step 3: Configure Environment

Copy and paste `.env.example` in a new `.env` file in the proxy directory:

```bash
cd apps/proxy && cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
# apps/proxy/.env
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TUNNEL_URL=http://localhost:3847
```

## Step 4: Start a Tunnel

Open a new terminal and start a tunnel to expose the proxy:

```bash
ngrok http 8787
```

Copy the public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`).

Now update your Linear OAuth app's **Redirect URI** to:

```
https://abc123.ngrok.io/auth/linear/callback
```

## Step 5: Configure Linear Webhook

1. Go to **Linear Settings** → **API** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **New Webhook**
3. Set the URL to your tunnel: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/linear`
4. Select App events: **Agent sessions events**
5. Click **Create**

## Step 6: Start the Proxy

```bash
cd apps/proxy
bun run dev
```

You should see:

```
Starting local server...
Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

## Step 7: Initialize Agent Configuration

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd apps/cli
sniff init
```

Edit the generated `sniff.yml`:

```yaml
version: "2.0"

agents:
  - id: engineer
    name: Engineer
    systemPrompt: |
      You are a software engineer. Help with coding tasks,
      bug fixes, and code reviews. Write clean, tested code.
    runner:
      claude:
        allowedTools:
          - Read
          - Write
          - Edit
          - Glob
          - Grep
          - Bash
        permissionMode: acceptEdits
        maxTurns: 50
```

## Step 8: Authenticate with Linear

```bash
export SNIFF_PROXY_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
sniff auth linear
```

This opens your browser for OAuth. After authorizing, tokens are stored locally.

## Step 9: Start the Agent

```bash
sniff start
```

You should see:

```
Sniff CLI starting...
Loaded 1 agent(s): Engineer
Server listening on http://localhost:3847
```

## Step 10: Test It Out

1. Create a new issue in Linear
2. Watch your terminal - the agent will process the issue
3. Check Linear - the agent's response appears as a comment

## Production Deployment

For production, deploy the proxy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
cd apps/proxy

# Set secrets
npx wrangler secret put LINEAR_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put TUNNEL_URL  # Your production tunnel URL

# Deploy
npx wrangler deploy
```

Then update your Linear OAuth app and webhook to use the Cloudflare Worker URL.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth fails or times out">
    - Verify the redirect URI in Linear matches your tunnel URL + `/auth/linear/callback`
    - Check that the proxy is running: `bun run dev`
    - Ensure ngrok is forwarding to port 8787
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Webhook not reaching CLI">
  - Check the proxy logs for incoming webhook requests - Verify TUNNEL_URL in
  `.dev.vars` is `http://localhost:3847` - Ensure the CLI is running: `sniff
  start`
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Agent not responding to issues">
  - Verify the issue has the correct label (matches `label` in config) - Check
  CLI logs for errors - Ensure Linear webhook is pointing to your tunnel URL
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token refresh errors">
    - Re-authenticate: `sniff auth linear --force`
    - Verify LINEAR_CLIENT_ID and LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET are correct in `.dev.vars`
  </Accordion>
