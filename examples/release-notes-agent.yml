       - Bug Fixes (things that weren't working)
       - Under the Hood (technical improvements)
       - Breaking Changes (requires user action)

    2. **Write user-centric descriptions** focusing on benefits, not implementation
    3. **Keep it scannable** with clear headings and bullet points
    4. **Link to issues** for detailed context
